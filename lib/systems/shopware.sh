This is a Shopware 6 full shop installation.

Shopware 6 directory structure:

  config/           - Symfony/Shopware config (packages/shopware.yaml, services.yaml)
  custom/           - Plugins and apps
    static-plugins/ - Developer-managed plugins, committed to Git (YOUR WORKING AREA)
      MeinPlugin/

          Controller/
          Service/

          Migration/           - DB migrations
          Resources/

In ARCHITECTURE.md, include a 'Working Scope' section:
- Allowed working directories: custom/static-plugins/, config/
- READ-ONLY: vendor/, public/, var/, bin/, files/ (managed by Shopware/Composer)
- NEVER TOUCH: custom/plugins/ (managed by Shopware Admin), deployment-overrides/ (managed by deployment pipeline)
- List installed custom plugins and apps from custom/ and their paths
- Core Shopware code in vendor/shopware/ must NEVER be modified"

    SHOPWARE_RULE="
Add a 'Shopware 6' section under Critical Rules:
- DAL-First: Always use EntityRepository -- never raw DBAL/SQL queries
- Service-Container: Business logic belongs in Services, registered in
  src/Resources/config/services.xml using Constructor Injection only
- Migrations: SQL migrations go in src/Migration/ and must be idempotent
- Criteria Performance: Add only required associations -- avoid over-fetching
- Code Style: PSR-12, strict_types=1 declarations in every PHP file
- Admin: Vue.js 3 + Shopware meteor-component-library for Admin extensions
- Cache: Always run bin/console cache:clear after config/container changes
- Only modify files in custom/static-plugins/ and config/
- Never modify custom/plugins/ (admin-managed), vendor/, public/, var/, deployment-overrides/, or core Shopware files
- Use Shopware plugin hooks and decorators for customization
- Plugin structure: src/ (PHP), Resources/config/ (DI, routes), Resources/views/ (Twig), Resources/public/ (assets)
- Run bin/console commands for cache clear, plugin lifecycle
- Deployment: Never run dep, deployer, or any Deployer commands -- deployment is handled by the team's pipeline, not by Claude

Also add a 'MCP Servers' section to CLAUDE.md:
## MCP Servers
### shopware-admin-mcp
Configured in .mcp.json -- provides direct access to the Shopware Admin API.

Use it when you need to:
- Inspect live entity data (products, orders, customers, categories, properties)
- Look up field names, associations, or entity schemas before writing DAL code
- Verify that a plugin's data changes actually persisted correctly
- Create or update entities to set up test fixtures or seed data
- Debug data issues without writing a one-off console command

Do NOT use it for:
- Code generation or file edits (use standard tools)
- Tasks that only touch the local codebase with no data dependency"

    SHOPWARE_RULE="
Add a 'Shopware 6 Plugin' section under Critical Rules:
- DAL-First: Always use EntityRepository -- never raw DBAL/SQL queries
- Service-Container: Logic in Services, registered in src/Resources/config/services.xml
  using Constructor Injection; never use service locator pattern
- Migrations: SQL migrations in src/Migration/ -- must be idempotent (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS)
- Subscribers: New event subscribers need both the PHP class AND the XML service tag
  (shopware.event.subscriber) in services.xml
- Controllers: Use Symfony routing attributes/annotations with correct RouteScope
- Tests: Integration tests extend KernelTestBase; unit tests are plain PHPUnit
- Criteria Performance: Minimize associations -- only add what the use-case requires
- Code Style: PSR-12 standards, strict_types=1, typed properties
- Deployment: Never run dep, deployer, or any Deployer commands -- deployment is handled by the team's pipeline, not by Claude

Configured in .mcp.json -- provides direct access to the Shopware Admin API of the target shop.

Use it when you need to:
- Inspect live entity data (products, orders, customers, categories, properties)
- Look up field names, associations, or entity schemas before writing DAL code
- Verify that the plugin's data changes actually persisted correctly in the shop
- Create or update entities to set up test fixtures or reproduce a bug
- Debug data issues without writing a one-off console command

Do NOT use it for:
- Code generation or file edits (use standard tools)
- Tasks that only touch the local plugin codebase with no data dependency"

    SHOPWARE_INSTRUCTION="
This is a standalone Shopware 6 plugin project.
Stack: Shopware 6.6+, Symfony 7.x, Vue.js 3, PHP 8.3+.

Standard Shopware plugin structure:
  src/
    PluginName.php       - Plugin base class (extends Plugin)
    Controller/          - Storefront/API controllers
    Service/             - Business logic services
    Entity/              - Custom entities (ORM)
    Migration/           - Database migrations
    Subscriber/          - Event subscribers
    Resources/
      config/
        services.xml     - Dependency Injection definitions
        routes.xml       - Route definitions
      views/             - Twig templates (storefront, admin)
      public/            - Static assets (JS, CSS, images)
  tests/                 - PHPUnit tests
  composer.json          - Plugin metadata and dependencies

In ARCHITECTURE.md, include:
- Plugin namespace and bootstrap class location (src/*Plugin.php or src/*Bundle.php)
- Standard directory conventions as above
- Key patterns: DAL (EntityRepository for all DB access), Services (DI container),
  Subscribers (event-driven hooks), Admin Extensions (Vue.js 3 components)
- This plugin installs into a Shopware 6 shop via Composer"
