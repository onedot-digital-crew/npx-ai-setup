Displays a Kanban board of active specs plus only the latest 10 completed specs. Use for an overview of the current spec pipeline without scanning the full completed archive.

## Step 1: Show board (zero tokens)

!.claude/scripts/spec-board.sh

## Step 2: Consistency Check + Repair

After the board output above, scan only the specs shown on the board for inconsistencies:

**Type A — Stale in-progress**: spec has all steps `- [x]` but status is still `in-progress` or `in-review` (not moved to `specs/completed/`).

**Type B — Wrong location**: a shown spec has status `completed` but file is still in `specs/` (not in `specs/completed/`).

**Type C — Stale in-review**: spec has status `in-review` but 0 steps are checked `- [x]`. Indicates a verify-fail abort or manual status change without implementation. Needs investigation.

**Type D — Non-canonical status**: spec uses a synonym (`done`, `finished`, `closed`, `merged`, `resolved`, `wip`, `review`, …) instead of the canonical enum (`draft|in-progress|in-review|blocked|completed`). The board normalizes for display, but the file vocab must be canonical.

If any inconsistencies are found, list them:

```
⚠️  Inconsistencies found:
  #NNN Title — all steps done but status is "in-progress" (Type A)
  #MMM Title — status "completed" but file not in specs/completed/ (Type B)
  #PPP Title — status "in-review" but 0 steps checked (Type C — needs attention)
  #QQQ Title — status "done" — non-canonical, should be "completed" (Type D)
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask:

```
Fix these inconsistencies automatically?
A) Fix all — update status and move files now
B) Fix selected — I'll choose one by one
C) Skip — leave as is
```

- **Option A**: For each inconsistency:
  - Type A: set status to `completed`, move `specs/NNN-*.md` → `specs/completed/NNN-*.md`
  - Type B: move `specs/NNN-*.md` → `specs/completed/NNN-*.md`
  - Type C: reset status to `draft` so the spec re-enters the queue for implementation
  - Type D: rewrite status to canonical (synonym map: `done|finished|closed|merged|resolved`→`completed`, `wip|working|active`→`in-progress`, `review|reviewing`→`in-review`); if the canonical value is `completed`, also move file to `specs/completed/`
  - Report each fix.
- **Option B**: For each inconsistency, ask individually with AskUserQuestion (Fix / Skip). For Type C, offer two fix options: "Reset to draft" or "Keep in-review (manual review needed)".
- **Option C**: Skip all fixes.

## Rules

- Only write or move files during step 2 and only after user confirms.
- If `specs/` does not exist or has no spec files, report "No specs found" and stop.
- The default board is intentionally windowed: all open specs + latest 10 completed specs only.

## Next Step

To work on a spec, run `/spec-work NNN`.
