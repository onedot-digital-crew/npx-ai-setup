# Spec Work All — Batch Execute Draft Specs

Executes all draft specs in `specs/` in dependency-aware waves using isolated Git worktrees.

## Process

### 1. Discover draft specs
Scan `specs/` for `NNN-*.md` (excluding `specs/completed/`). Only `Status: draft`. Read Goal and Out of Scope for dependency map. No drafts → report and stop.

### 2. Dependency detection
A spec depends on another if Out of Scope names a spec number. Group into parallel (no deps) and sequential (run after dependency).

### 3. Execute in waves

**Setup** per spec: derive branch `spec/NNN-title`, set status to `in-progress` and branch in spec header.

**Execution**: Max 2 concurrent worktree agents per wave. Launch via Agent tool with `isolation: "worktree"`, `model: sonnet`.

**Subagent prompt** must include:
1. `git branch -m spec/NNN-title`
2. Copy .env from main repo: `MAIN_REPO=$(git worktree list | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')` then copy all `.env*` except `.env.example` and `.env.template`
3. Install deps: check for `bun.lockb` → `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, else `package-lock.json` → `npm ci`, else `pnpm-lock.yaml` → `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, else `yarn.lock` → `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
4. Execute spec steps, verify criteria, commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "spec(NNN): [title]"`

Low-complexity specs (1-2 files, no build) can run directly in main repo.

**Post-processing per subagent:**

Failed: set `blocked`, add `## Review Feedback`, remove worktree, report.

Succeeded:
1. Check off all steps and criteria in spec
2. Status → `in-review`
3. Add CHANGELOG entry under `## [Unreleased]`
4. Remove worktree (branch preserved for `/spec-review`)

### 4. Final summary
```bash
git worktree prune && rm -rf .claude/worktrees/* 2>/dev/null
```
Report completed/failed specs with IDs, titles, branches. Next: `/spec-review NNN` or `/spec-board`.

## Skill-Trimming Quality Gate

When a spec modifies SKILL.md files: after subagent completes but before marking `in-review`, spawn a **quality-diff subagent** (model: haiku) that compares `git diff` of each changed SKILL.md. It must classify every removed element as REDUNDANT or CRITICAL. Any CRITICAL removal blocks the spec — set `blocked` instead of `in-review`, report findings.

## Rules
- Max 2 concurrent worktree agents — more causes auth failures
- Follow specs exactly — no scope creep
- Blocked steps: mark unchecked, continue remaining
- Always report failures with reason
