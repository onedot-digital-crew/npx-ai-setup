# General Coding Rules

## Verify, Don't Guess

Never assume import paths, function names, or API routes. Verify by reading the relevant file.
Never fabricate configuration formats or assume config file schemas exist — check docs or existing examples first.
When unsure about current state, run `git diff` to see what has actually changed this session.

## Surface Ambiguity, Don't Pick Silently

If the request has multiple plausible interpretations, present them — don't choose silently.
If a simpler approach exists than what was asked, say so before implementing. Push back when warranted.
If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## Human Approval Gates

Before finalizing any deliverable, present a summary and ask for confirmation.
Never proceed to the next workflow phase without explicit user approval.

## Skill-First

Before implementing anything manually, check installed skills:

1. Run `ls .claude/skills/` to list available skills
2. If a skill matches the task, invoke it via the `Skill` tool — do not reimplement
3. If no skill matches, ask the user before proceeding with manual implementation

## External Systems & Web Fetching

Library/API/SDK/CLI/Cloud-Service docs: Context7 MUST be first (`resolve-library-id` → `query-docs`). WebFetch/WebSearch only if no match — state fallback explicitly. Applies to known libs too (Nuxt, Storyblok, Shopify, Laravel, etc.) — training data stales.
Skip Context7 only for: own-code refactor, business logic, general concepts, user-provided URL.
Non-library web pages: `defuddle parse <url> --md`; WebFetch only if defuddle unavailable.

## MCP Servers

Project `.mcp.json` overrides global servers with the same name.
For non-interactive `claude -p` runs: `--bare` disables all MCP servers.

## Destructive Operations

Before confirming deletion, revert, or disable operations as "correct behavior", trace through the actual code path that would be affected. Show the specific lines, not just reasoning.

## Sandbox Safety

Never set `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` without first explaining why the sandbox blocks the command and receiving explicit user confirmation.
