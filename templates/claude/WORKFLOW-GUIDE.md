# Claude Code — Developer Workflow Guide

Quick reference for the AI-assisted development workflow installed by `@onedot/ai-setup`.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
claude                # open Claude Code in your project
/spec-board           # see all active specs
/doctor               # verify setup health
```

---

## Daily Workflow

### Small tasks (single file, config, typo)
Describe it directly. Claude handles it.

### Larger tasks (3+ files, new feature, architecture)
Use spec-driven development:

```
/spec "task description"       # challenge idea, then create structured spec
/spec-validate NNN             # validate quality before executing
/spec-work NNN                 # execute step by step, commit after each step
/spec-review NNN               # review against acceptance criteria, finish gate
/spec-board                    # Kanban overview of all specs
```

**Lifecycle:** `draft` → `in-progress` → `in-review` → `completed`

Parallel execution: `/spec-work-all` runs all draft specs in isolated Git worktrees.

### Session management
```
/pause                         # save state to .continue-here.md, commit WIP
/resume                        # restore state, route to next action
```

### After a task
```
/commit                        # conventional commit message
/reflect                       # capture learnings as permanent rules
```

## Hooks (13)

Run automatically — no manual invocation needed.

| Hook | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `circuit-breaker` | PostToolUse | Stops infinite edit loops (3 edits same file) |
| `protect-files` | PreToolUse | Blocks edits to build output and lock files |
| `post-edit-lint` | PostToolUse | Runs linter after edits (when available) |

---

## Context Files

Located in `.agents/context/` — auto-generated, committed, shared across team.

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `STACK.md` | Tech stack, versions, key dependencies |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | System architecture and data flows |
| `CONVENTIONS.md` | Naming patterns, coding standards, testing |
| `PATTERNS.md` | Established patterns to reuse (via `/analyze`) |
| `AUDIT.md` | Improvement opportunities (via `/analyze`) |

Regenerate: re-run `npx @onedot/ai-setup` → choose **Regenerate** → select **Context**.

## Claude Code Tips

| Shortcut | What |
|----------|------|
| `Esc Esc` | Rewind last response (recover tokens) |
| `Up arrow` | After interrupt: restore prompt + rewind |
| `! git status` | Run bash command directly (no token overhead) |
| `@src/index.ts` | Import file into context compactly |
| `ultrathink:` | Prefix for extended reasoning |
| `/compact` | Compress context at 80% usage |

---

## Token-Efficient Web Fetching

Reading web pages with WebFetch returns raw HTML — ~5× more tokens than needed. Two better options:

| Method | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| **defuddle** (CLI) | `defuddle parse https://example.com --md` |
| **markdown.new** (URL prefix) | `https://markdown.new/https://example.com` |

Both strip navigation, ads, and clutter — ~80% token savings. Use WebFetch only when JavaScript rendering is required.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Claude keeps editing the same file in a loop?**
Circuit-breaker triggers after 3 edits. Stop, re-describe the problem differently.

**Context is stale after a long session?**
Use `Esc Esc` to compress, or `/pause` + start fresh session + `/resume`.

**Spec steps partially checked after a crash?**
Re-run `/spec-work NNN` — it detects `[x]` steps and resumes from the first unchecked.

**Build fails after spec-work?**
Run `/build-fix` — it parses the first error, applies a minimal fix, rebuilds, repeats.

**Can't find a command?**
Type `/` in Claude Code for autocomplete, or check `.claude/commands/`.

**Update ai-setup:**
```
/update
```
