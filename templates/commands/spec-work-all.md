Execute all draft specs in `specs/` using parallel subagents with native worktree isolation.

## Process

### 1. Discover draft specs
Scan `specs/` for all `NNN-*.md` files (excluding `specs/completed/`). Only pick specs with `Status: draft`. Read each spec's Goal and Out of Scope to build a dependency map.

### 2. Dependency detection
A spec is **dependent** on another if its "Out of Scope" section explicitly names another spec number (e.g. "Spec 010", "spec 009"). Dependent specs must run after the spec they reference.

Group specs into:
- **Parallel group**: specs with no dependencies on each other
- **Sequential queue**: specs that depend on a parallel spec (run after their dependency completes)

### 3. Execute in waves

#### Wave setup — before launching subagents
For each spec in the current wave:

1. Derive branch name: `spec/NNN-title` (lowercase, hyphens, from spec filename without `.md`)
2. Update spec header in the **main working directory** spec file:
   - Set `**Status**: in-progress`
   - Set `**Branch**: spec/NNN-title`

#### Wave execution — parallel subagents
Launch one Task subagent per spec simultaneously using `isolation: "worktree"`. Each subagent receives:

**Prompt for each subagent:**
```
Execute this spec. You are running in an isolated Git worktree.

Setup steps (do first, before implementing the spec):
1. Rename the current branch to `spec/NNN-title`:
   git branch -m spec/NNN-title
2. Get the main repo path (the parent of this worktree):
   MAIN_REPO=$(git worktree list | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
3. Copy .env files from the main repo (skip .env.example and .env.template):
   for f in "$MAIN_REPO"/.env*; do
     [[ -f "$f" ]] || continue
     base=$(basename "$f")
     [[ "$base" == ".env.example" || "$base" == ".env.template" ]] && continue
     cp "$f" . 2>/dev/null || echo "⚠️  Could not copy $base — continuing"
   done
4. Install dependencies if a lockfile exists (run from worktree root):
   if [ -f "bun.lockb" ]; then bun install --frozen-lockfile 2>/dev/null || echo "⚠️  bun install failed"
   elif [ -f "package-lock.json" ]; then npm ci 2>/dev/null || echo "⚠️  npm ci failed"
   elif [ -f "pnpm-lock.yaml" ]; then pnpm install --frozen-lockfile 2>/dev/null || echo "⚠️  pnpm install failed"
   elif [ -f "yarn.lock" ]; then yarn install --frozen-lockfile 2>/dev/null || echo "⚠️  yarn install failed"
   fi

Implementation steps:
1. Read .agents/context/CONVENTIONS.md and .agents/context/STACK.md if they exist
2. Load relevant skills if referenced in the spec's Context section
3. Execute each spec step in order
4. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
5. Stage and commit all changes:
   git add -u && git commit -m "spec(NNN): [spec title]"
```

#### Wave post-processing — after each subagent returns
For each completed subagent, using the branch and worktree path from the Task result:

1. Check all spec steps off in `specs/NNN-*.md`
2. Mark all acceptance criteria as checked
3. Set spec status to `in-review`
4. Prepend CHANGELOG entry under `## [Unreleased]`:
   - Add: `- **Spec NNN**: [Title] — [1-sentence summary]`
   - Insert after the `## [Unreleased]` heading

**Wave 2+**: After each wave completes, launch the next wave of specs that are now unblocked.

### 4. Final summary
After all waves complete, report:
- Completed specs (with spec ID, title, and branch name)
- Failed specs (with spec ID and reason)
- Total: N completed, M failed
- Next step: `Run /spec-review NNN for each completed spec, or /spec-board for overview`

## Rules
- Follow each spec exactly — no scope creep
- If a step in a spec is blocked or unclear, mark it unchecked and continue remaining steps
- If `specs/` has no draft specs, report "No draft specs found" and stop
- If a Task subagent fails, mark the spec as `blocked` and report the error
