Validates spec $ARGUMENTS against 10 quality metrics before execution. Run before `/spec-work` to catch weak specs early.

## Process

### 1. Find the spec
If `$ARGUMENTS` is a number (e.g. `011`), open `specs/011-*.md`. If it's a filename, open that directly. If empty, list all draft specs in `specs/` and ask which to validate.

### 2. Validate status
Only validate specs with `Status: draft`. If `in-progress`, `in-review`, or `completed` → report status and stop.

### 3. Load context
Read `.agents/context/CONVENTIONS.md` if it exists — use it to calibrate expectations for test coverage, code patterns, and integration standards.

### 4. Score the spec

Evaluate each metric from 0–100. Be strict — a spec that doesn't answer the question scores ≤50.

| # | Metric | Question to answer |
|---|--------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Goal Clarity** | Is the one-sentence goal specific, bounded, and measurable? Can you tell when it's done? |
| 2 | **Step Decomposition** | Are steps atomic and each achievable in one focused session? No "implement X" megasteps. |
| 3 | **Dependency Identification** | Are external dependencies (other specs, APIs, libs, env vars) named explicitly? |
| 4 | **Coverage Completeness** | Do the steps collectively cover the entire goal — nothing obviously missing? |
| 5 | **Acceptance Criteria Quality** | Are criteria specific and testable (not vague)? Can each be checked YES/NO? |
| 6 | **Scope Coherence** | Is the scope realistic for a single spec? Not too large, not trivially small? |
| 7 | **Risk & Blockers** | Are known risks, ambiguities, or potential blockers mentioned (in Context or Out of Scope)? |
| 8 | **File Coverage** | Are all files that will realistically change listed in "Files to Modify"? |
| 9 | **Out of Scope Clarity** | Is scope exclusion precise enough to prevent creep during execution? |
| 10 | **Integration Awareness** | Does the spec account for how changes integrate with existing code, tests, or systems? |

### 6. Verdict

**PASS** (avg ≥ 80 AND no metric < 65):
- Report: "Spec NNN is ready for execution. Run `/spec-work NNN`."
- No changes to the spec file.

**FAIL** (avg < 80 OR any metric < 65):
- List every metric below threshold with a specific, actionable improvement (1-2 sentences per issue).
- Do NOT make changes to the spec. Let the user revise it.
- Report: "Spec NNN needs improvement before execution. Fix the issues above and re-run `/spec-validate NNN`."

## Rules
- **Read-only** — never modify the spec or any file.
- Score honestly. A spec that passes with weak scores wastes execution compute.
- Only report metrics that actually fail. Don't pad passing specs with warnings.
- This command does NOT block `/spec-work` — it's advisory. But weak specs ship weak code.
