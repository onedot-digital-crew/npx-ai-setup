Executes spec $ARGUMENTS step by step and verifies acceptance criteria. Use to implement a single approved spec.

## Process

1. **Find the spec**: If `$ARGUMENTS` is a number (e.g. `001`), open `specs/001-*.md`. If it's a filename, open that directly. If empty, list all draft specs in `specs/` and ask which one to work on.

2. **Read the spec** and understand Goal, Steps, and Files to Modify.

3. **Branch setup**: Ask the user whether to create a new branch before starting work.
   - Derive the branch name from the spec filename: `spec/NNN-title` (lowercase, hyphens, strip `.md`)
   - If user says yes: run `git checkout -b spec/NNN-title`. If the branch already exists, offer to switch to it with `git checkout spec/NNN-title`.
   - Update the spec header: set `**Branch**: spec/NNN-title` (or `—` if no branch created).

4. **Read project context**: Skim `.agents/context/CONVENTIONS.md` and `.agents/context/STACK.md` to follow project patterns and use correct libraries.

5. **Load relevant skills**: If the spec's Context section mentions skills, read `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for each and apply throughout execution. Skip if none listed.

6. **Architectural review** (high-complexity specs only): Check if the spec header contains `**Complexity**: high`. If yes, spawn the `code-architect` agent via Agent tool, passing the full spec content as the prompt. Then:
   - If the verdict is **REDESIGN**: stop immediately, report all concerns to the user, and do not proceed.
   - If the verdict is **PROCEED WITH CHANGES**: report the concerns to the user, then continue.
   - If the verdict is **PROCEED**: continue normally.

7. **Start work**: Update the spec header — set `**Status**: in-progress`.

8. **Output progress checklist**: Before executing, print a checklist of all steps found in the spec:
   ```
   Progress — Spec NNN
   [ ] Step 1: <title>
   [ ] Step 2: <title>
   ...
   ```
   Check off each item (`[x]`) as you complete it so the user can follow along.

9. **Resume check**: Before executing, scan the spec file for already-checked steps (`- [x]`). If any are found, print a summary:
   ```
   Resuming Spec NNN — skipping N completed steps: Step 1, Step 2, ...
   Continuing from Step N.
   ```
   Skip those steps and begin from the first unchecked step. If all steps are already checked, jump to step 10.

10. **Execute each step** in order:
    - Implement the change
    - After completing a step, edit the spec file to check it off: `- [ ]` -> `- [x]`
    - Update the printed progress checklist to reflect the completed step
    - Commit the completed step: `git add -A && git commit -m "spec(NNN): step N — <title>"`
    - If a step is blocked or unclear, stop and ask the user

11. **Verify acceptance criteria**: After all steps are done, check each acceptance criterion. Mark them as checked in the spec.

12. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Add an entry to the `## [Unreleased]` section in `CHANGELOG.md`:
    - Find the `## [Unreleased]` heading (it's just below the `<!-- Entries are prepended below this line, newest first -->` comment)
    - Insert after `## [Unreleased]`: `- **Spec NNN**: [Spec title] — [1-sentence summary of what changed]`
    - Do NOT create date headings — entries accumulate under [Unreleased] until `/release` is run

13. **Verify implementation**: Spawn `verify-app` via Agent tool with the prompt:
    > "Verify that the implementation for spec NNN is correct. Check if the project has a test suite and run it. Check if there is a build command and run it. Report PASS or FAIL."
    - If verify-app returns **PASS**: continue to the next step.
    - If verify-app returns **FAIL**: trigger the **Haiku Investigator** (exactly once — never in a loop):

    > **Haiku Investigator** — spawn a sub-agent with these constraints:
    > - Model: haiku | Allowed tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash (read-only: `cat`, `ls`, `grep`, `find`) | **Forbidden: Write, Edit**
    > - Prompt: "Diagnose this build/test failure. Read the error output and relevant source files. Identify the root cause. Output: (1) root cause in one sentence, (2) the specific line(s) to fix, (3) exact fix to apply. Do NOT edit any files."
    > - Pass the full verify-app error output to the investigator.
    
    Apply the investigator's suggested fix as a **single targeted edit**, then run verify-app once more.
    - If the second verify-app returns **PASS**: continue normally.
    - If the second verify-app returns **FAIL**: set status to `in-review`, report the investigator's diagnosis and remaining error, **stop**. Do NOT proceed to step 16 (code-reviewer). Do NOT run the investigator again. Suggest: `Fix the reported issues and re-run /spec-work NNN`.

14. **Optional cleanup**: Offer to run `/simplify` to improve code quality before review. If the user confirms (or execution is non-interactive), invoke it. Skip if the user declines or if no significant code was changed.

15. **Update status**: Set spec status to `in-review` now — before spawning code-reviewer. This ensures status is saved even if the agent call fails.

16. **Auto-review**: Spawn the `code-reviewer` agent via Agent tool to review the changes. Pass the spec content and the current branch name so the agent can run the correct diff.
    - If verdict is **FAIL**: leave status as `in-review`. Report the issues. Suggest: `Run /spec-review NNN to review manually.`
    - If verdict is **PASS** or **CONCERNS**: set status to `completed`, move spec file `specs/NNN-*.md` → `specs/completed/NNN-*.md`. Report: "Auto-review passed. Spec NNN completed."

## Rules
- **ALWAYS update status and move the file when done — this is the single most important step.** Status update (step 15) happens before the review agent — never skip it.
- Follow the spec exactly — nothing outside the Steps and within scope.
- Check off each step in the spec file as you complete it (progress tracking).
- Commit after each completed step (`git add -A && git commit -m "spec(NNN): step N — <title>"`). This enables crash resilience and resume.
- If a step fails or is blocked, leave it unchecked, set status to `blocked`, and ask the user.
- If called with `--complete` flag, skip steps 13–15: set status directly to `completed` and move to `specs/completed/` (legacy behavior).
