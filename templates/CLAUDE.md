## Communication Protocol
No small talk. Just do it.
Confirmations one word (Done, Fixed). Show code changes as diff only.

## Project Documentation
Technical documentation in `.planning/codebase/` (created by `/gsd:map-codebase`).
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture and data flow
- `CONVENTIONS.md` - Coding standards and patterns
- `STACK.md` - Technology stack and versions
- Project context in `.planning/PROJECT.md` (created by `/gsd:new-project`)

## Workflow (GSD)
1. `/gsd:map-codebase` - Analyze existing code (brownfield)
2. `/gsd:new-project` - Initialize project planning
3. `/gsd:plan-phase N` - Plan next phase
4. `/gsd:execute-phase N` - Execute phase
5. `/gsd:verify-work N` - User acceptance testing

## Critical Rules
[Add project-specific coding rules here]
