Challenge and critically evaluate this feature idea before any implementation: **$ARGUMENTS**

## When to Use
- Big ideas that touch >5 files or introduce new systems/patterns
- Before investing time in a spec for something you're unsure about
- When `/spec` Quick Triage recommends it (high complexity detected)
- When you want a GO/SIMPLIFY/REJECT verdict before planning

## When NOT to Use
- Simple tasks (typos, config, single-file fixes) → just do it or `/spec` directly
- Evaluating external tools/repos → use `/research` instead
- Open-ended exploration without a concrete proposal → use `/explore` instead
- You already know this needs to be built → skip to `/spec`

## Process

### Phase 1 — Restate the Idea
Summarize the proposed feature in 1-2 sentences in your own words to confirm understanding.

### Phase 2 — Concept Fit
Read `.agents/context/CONCEPT.md` now. If the file does not exist, skip the concept fit check entirely and note "No CONCEPT.md found — concept fit check skipped." Otherwise, evaluate:
- Does this align with the project's core principles as defined in `.agents/context/CONCEPT.md`?
- Does it fit the distinction described in CONCEPT.md (e.g., templates not generation, or the project's primary abstraction)?
- Would this belong in the core layer, or is it scope creep?

Rate concept fit: **ALIGNED / BORDERLINE / MISALIGNED** (skip if CONCEPT.md missing)

### Phase 3 — Necessity
Is this actually needed? Challenge it hard:
- What problem does it solve? Is that problem real or hypothetical?
- What happens if we don't build it? Can users work without it?
- Is this solving a problem that users have reported, or a problem we imagined?

### Phase 4 — Overhead & Maintenance Cost
- How much ongoing maintenance does this add?
- Does it increase the surface area of the tool (more flags, more config, more docs)?
- What breaks if this feature has a bug?
- Does it add complexity that slows down the core promise of this project?

### Phase 5 — Complexity & Risks
- How many files need to change?
- Does this require new dependencies?
- What edge cases or failure modes exist?
- Does this interact with hooks, agents, or the CLI in unexpected ways?

### Phase 6 — Simpler Alternatives
List 1-3 alternatives, including:
- A simpler version of the same idea (scope reduction)
- A workaround that avoids building anything new
- **"Don't build it"** — explicitly state this as an option if it applies

Also scan the codebase with Glob and Grep to check if similar functionality already exists.

### Phase 6b — Stakeholder Perspectives

Simulate the following viewpoints. Skip any perspective that is clearly not applicable (e.g. skip UX for a CLI-only backend change — state "N/A" with a one-line reason).

**Security Engineer** — Does this introduce attack surface, data exposure, or trust boundary issues? Are there auth, input validation, or secrets-handling concerns?

**UX Designer** — Does this affect the user-facing experience or discoverability? Is the interaction model consistent with existing conventions? Could it confuse or overwhelm users?

**DevOps Engineer** — Does this impact deployment, CI/CD, environment config, or observability? Are there operational risks (rollback difficulty, missing metrics, config drift)?

**End User** — Does this solve a problem the user actually has? Is it discoverable without reading docs? Could it cause unintended side effects the user would not expect?

### Phase 7 — Verdict

Choose exactly one. Incorporate concerns raised in Phase 6b into the rationale.

**GO** — Concept fits, clearly needed, manageable complexity. Recommend proceeding.

**SIMPLIFY** — The idea has merit but the proposed scope is too large. State the smaller version worth building.

**REJECT** — Misaligned with concept, unnecessary, or adds unjustified overhead. State the reason explicitly.

---

## Rules
- Be direct and skeptical. The default stance is skepticism, not encouragement.
- Do NOT modify any files.
- Cite specific lines from `.agents/context/CONCEPT.md` when evaluating concept fit (only if file exists).
- The verdict must be unambiguous — no "it depends" conclusions.

## Next Step

- **GO verdict**: run `/spec "task description"` to create a structured implementation plan.
- **SIMPLIFY verdict**: run `/spec "reduced scope"` with the agreed-upon smaller scope.
- **REJECT verdict**: no action needed — idea is shelved.
