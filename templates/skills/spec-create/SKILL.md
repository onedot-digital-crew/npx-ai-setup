description: Create a new spec for a task. Use when the user says `/spec ...`, "create a spec for X", "write a spec for X", "spec out X", or "plan X as a spec". A spec is a structured implementation plan that lives in specs/NNN-title.md.

# Spec Create — Write a Structured Implementation Plan

Creates a spec file in `specs/NNN-title.md` for an approved task before coding begins.

## Process

1. **Challenge the idea** — before writing, ask:
   - What specific problem does this solve?
   - Is it in scope for this codebase?
   - What breaks if we don't build it?

2. **Clarify if needed** — ask 1-3 focused questions if the task is ambiguous. Wait for answers.

3. **Determine the next spec number** — run `ls specs/*.md | sort | tail -1` to find the highest number, increment by 1.

4. **Think through implementation**:
   - Which files change?
   - What's the exact change in each file?
   - Edge cases and failure modes?
   - Hidden complexity?

5. **Write the spec file** `specs/NNN-title.md` using this template:
   - Goal
   - Context
   - Steps
   - Acceptance Criteria
   - Files to Modify
   - Out of Scope

## Rules
- Steps must be atomic — one file or system per step
- Acceptance criteria must be verifiable without running the full app
- Keep specs under 60 lines / 8 steps — split if larger
- Status stays `draft` until the user approves and runs spec-work
