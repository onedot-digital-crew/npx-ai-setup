name: spec-work-all
description: Execute all draft specs in parallel waves using isolated Git worktrees. Invoke when the user wants to batch-implement everything at once: `/spec-work-all`, "run all specs", "implement everything", "do all the drafts", "work on all pending specs", "batch implement", "run all ready specs", "go through all my specs". Also triggers when the user has multiple draft specs and wants them all done in one go. Does NOT trigger for working on a single specific spec number, listing specs, or reviewing/validating a spec.

# Spec Work All — Batch Execute Draft Specs

Executes all draft specs in `specs/` in dependency-aware waves using isolated Git worktrees.

## Process

### 1. Discover draft specs
Scan `specs/` for all `NNN-*.md` files (excluding `specs/completed/`). Only pick specs with `Status: draft`. Read each spec's Goal and Out of Scope to build a dependency map.

### 2. Dependency detection
A spec is **dependent** on another if its "Out of Scope" section explicitly names another spec number (e.g. "Spec 010", "spec 009"). Dependent specs must run after the spec they reference.

Group specs into:
- **Parallel group**: specs with no dependencies on each other
- **Sequential queue**: specs that depend on a parallel spec (run after their dependency completes)

If `specs/` has no draft specs, report "No draft specs found" and stop.

### 3. Execute in waves

#### Wave setup — before launching subagents
For each spec in the current wave:

1. Derive branch name: `spec/NNN-title` (lowercase, hyphens, from spec filename without `.md`)
2. Update spec header in the **main working directory** spec file:
   - Set `**Status**: in-progress`
   - Set `**Branch**: spec/NNN-title`

#### Wave execution — parallel subagents
**Max 2 concurrent worktree agents per wave.** Split larger waves into sub-waves of 2. Launch one Agent subagent per spec simultaneously using `isolation: "worktree"`.

**Prompt for each subagent:**
```
Execute this spec. You are running in an isolated Git worktree.
Do first:
1. Rename the current branch to `spec/NNN-title`:
   git branch -m spec/NNN-title
2. Get the main repo path (the parent of this worktree):
   MAIN_REPO=$(git worktree list | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
3. Copy .env files from the main repo (skip .env.example and .env.template):
   for f in "$MAIN_REPO"/.env*; do
     [[ -f "$f" ]] || continue
     base=$(basename "$f")
     [[ "$base" == ".env.example" || "$base" == ".env.template" ]] && continue
     cp "$f" . 2>/dev/null || echo "⚠️  Could not copy $base — continuing"
   done
4. Install dependencies if a lockfile exists (run from worktree root):
   if [ -f "bun.lockb" ]; then bun install --frozen-lockfile 2>/dev/null || echo "⚠️  bun install failed"
   elif [ -f "package-lock.json" ]; then npm ci 2>/dev/null || echo "⚠️  npm ci failed"
   elif [ -f "pnpm-lock.yaml" ]; then pnpm install --frozen-lockfile 2>/dev/null || echo "⚠️  pnpm install failed"
   elif [ -f "yarn.lock" ]; then yarn install --frozen-lockfile 2>/dev/null || echo "⚠️  yarn install failed"
   fi
Then follow the `/spec-work` process for this spec inside the worktree: read context, load referenced skills, execute each step in order, verify acceptance criteria, then commit with `git add -A && git commit -m "spec(NNN): [spec title]"`.
Spec content:
[full spec content here]
```

Low-complexity specs (1-2 files, no build step) can run directly in the main repo without worktree isolation to save auth sessions.

#### Wave post-processing — after each subagent returns

If the subagent **failed or returned no usable result**:
1. Set spec status to `blocked`
2. Add a `## Review Feedback` section to the spec with: "subagent failed — [error message or 'no result returned']"
3. Remove the worktree:
   ```bash
   git worktree remove --force <worktree-path> 2>/dev/null; rm -rf <worktree-path> 2>/dev/null
   ```
4. Report: "Spec NNN blocked — subagent did not complete. Run `/spec-work NNN` to retry manually."
5. Skip remaining post-processing for this spec.

If the subagent **succeeded**:
1. Check all spec steps off in `specs/NNN-*.md`
2. Mark all acceptance criteria as checked
3. Set spec status to `in-review`
4. Prepend CHANGELOG entry under `## [Unreleased]`:
   - Add: `- **Spec NNN**: [Title] — [1-sentence summary]`
   - Insert after the `## [Unreleased]` heading
5. Remove the worktree (branch is preserved for `/spec-review`):
   ```bash
   git worktree remove --force <worktree-path> 2>/dev/null; rm -rf <worktree-path> 2>/dev/null
   ```

**Wave 2+**: After each wave completes, launch the next wave of specs that are now unblocked.

### 4. Final summary
After all waves complete:
1. Force-clean all worktrees:
   ```bash
   git worktree prune && rm -rf .claude/worktrees/* 2>/dev/null
   ```
2. Report:
   - Completed specs (with spec ID, title, and branch name)
   - Failed specs (with spec ID and reason)
   - Total: N completed, M failed
   - Next step: `Run /spec-review NNN for each completed spec, or /spec-board for overview`

## Rules

- **Max 2 concurrent worktree agents per wave.** Parallel agents each consume an auth session — more than 2 causes "Not logged in" failures. Split larger waves into sub-waves of 2.
- Low-complexity specs (1-2 files, no build step) can run directly in the main repo without worktree isolation to save auth sessions.
- Follow each spec exactly — no scope creep.
- If a step in a spec is blocked or unclear, mark it unchecked and continue remaining steps.
- Respect spec dependencies — dependent specs run after their dependency completes.
- Do not silently skip blocked specs — always report with reason.
- Report partial completion clearly.
- If an Agent subagent fails, mark the spec as `blocked` and report the error.
