Runs the complete spec lifecycle for spec $ARGUMENTS. Self-healing: fixes issues found during review automatically.

## Pipeline

### Phase 1 — Validate
Invoke `/spec-validate $ARGUMENTS`.
- **Grade A/B**: continue
- **Grade C**: fix the spec issues inline, re-validate once. Second C → stop.
- **Grade F**: stop, show fixes needed.

### Phase 2 — Implement
Invoke `/spec-work $ARGUMENTS --skip-validate`.
- All steps checked: continue
- Any step blocked: stop, report blocked steps.

### Phase 3 — Review
Invoke `/spec-review $ARGUMENTS`.
- **APPROVED**: continue to Phase 4
- **CHANGES REQUESTED**: apply the feedback fixes, re-run review once. Second CHANGES REQUESTED → stop, report remaining issues.
- **REJECTED**: stop.

### Phase 4 — Commit
Invoke `/commit`.

## Rules
- Self-healing: fix issues from validate (Grade C) and review (CHANGES REQUESTED) automatically — max 1 retry per phase.
- Grade F and REJECTED always stop — too broken to auto-fix.
- If resumed after manual fix, detect spec status and skip completed phases (e.g. `in-progress` skips Phase 1).
- Pass `--skip-validate` to spec-work since Phase 1 already validated.
